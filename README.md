# WebJavaProject, Event Organization

## This is a Java Spring Boot application that can make transactions for differrent types of events. There is a Client determined by >clientId, nume, prenume, cash. He is able to buy a ticket to an existing Event, determined by> eventId, eventName, eventStart, eventPrice. Each event has a description and a location where it is going to take place. I created a Ticket and Schedule entity in order to manage all the clients that want to participate at an event on a location.
